### Compatibility

 OpenCart 1.5.1.3 or higher.

### Functionalities

 1. Allowed to define the size of the images displayed in the module.
 2. I allowed to define the limit of last viewed products that will be displayed.
 3. Possibility of placing in various layouts and positions.

### Doubts

 1. Upload the module files to your store's root directory.
 2. In the store administration, access the menu Extensions-> Modules, and locate the module "Last Viewed Products", and click on the link "Install".
 3. After installing, click on the "Edit" link, and on the module configuration page click on the "Add" button, fill in the settings and then click on the "Save" button.
 4. You can add the module in any layout and in any position as many times as you want, but you have to add it at least once in the "Product" or "Product" layout for the correct functioning of the module.

### How to contribute

 1. Fork the project and edit the files you want.
 2. Make a Pull so that your suggestions for improvements are evaluated and accepted, if approved.
